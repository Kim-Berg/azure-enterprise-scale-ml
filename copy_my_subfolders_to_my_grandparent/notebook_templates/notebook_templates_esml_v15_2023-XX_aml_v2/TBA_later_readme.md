# TODO
- ESML will not be updated until certain features in Azure ML v2 has GA support. 
    - This since customers will not allow Public preview features, so it will not be used anyways.
    - This since this is an open source initive, and we do not want to spend time/risk on feature that may not go to GA status.

Hence we wait...and are all "prepped" and ready TODO!
