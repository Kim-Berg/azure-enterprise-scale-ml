    "# PRODUCTION phase: About this notebook\n",
    "- Purpose: Creates 1 of the 2 PIPELINES\n",
    "    - `2a) training pipeline:` TRAINS a model with Azure AutoML and with AZURE compute cluster and calculates test_set scoring, automatically compares if newly trained model is better.\n",
    "    \n",
    "## DETAILS - about this notebook and the 2a pipeline, generated\n",
    "- 1) Initiate ESMLPipelineFactory:\n",
    "- 2) `AUTO-GENERATE code: a snapshot folder` via ESML, that generates Python scripts and the `ESML runtime`\n",
    "    - 2_A_aml_pipeline\\4_inference\\batch\\\\`M11`\n",

    "            - `your_custom_code.py` is referenced from all the `in_2_silver_...` files such as: 2_A_aml_pipeline\\4_inference\\batch\\M11\\\\`in2silver_ds01_diabetes.py` and `silver_merged_2_gold`\n",
    "        - Edit the AutoML train file, you need to add some configuration. See instructions in notebook cells below.\n",
    "            -2_A_aml_pipeline\\4_inference\\batch\\\\`M11\\train_post_automl_step.py`\n",
    "- 3) `BUILDS the pipeline` of certain (IN_2_GOLD_TRAIN_AUTOML)\n",
    "    - An `Azure machine learning pipeline` with steps will be automatically genereated, based on your `lake_settings.json` dataset array.\n",
    "    - It is a `training pipeline` of ESML type `IN_2_GOLD_TRAIN_AUTOML`\n",
    "- 4) `EXECUTES the pipeline` (smoke testing purpose - see that it works...)\n",
    "    - 4a) The below happens in the pipeline steps:Training pipeline: (`IN_2_GOLD_TRAIN_AUTOML`) steps:\n",
    "        - Feature engineering of each in-data - via `IN_2_SILVER` steps.\n",
    "        - Merges all SILVERS to `GOLD`\n",
    "        - Splits the `GOLD` to 3 buckets: `GOLD_TRAIN, GOLD_VALIDATE, GOLD_TEST`\n",
    "        - Trains model\n",
    "        - Registers the newly trained model, tags it as `newly_trained`\n",
    "        - Calculates test_set scoring with the `ESMLTestescoringFactory`\n",
    "        - `INNER LOOP MLOps:` Compares in current environment `DEV` if model should be promoted, based on `test_set_scoring`\n",
    "        - `OUTER LOOP MLOps:` Compares in next environment `TEST` if model should be promoted, based on `test_set_scoring` \n",
    "            - E.g. compares best model in `DEV` with the leading model in `TEST`\n",
    "- 5) PUBLISH the pipeline\n",
    "    - Purpose: Now when the pipeline is `smoke tested`, we can publish is, to get a `pipeline_id to use in Azure Data factory`\n",
    "    - We want to PRINT the `pipeline ID` after publish also, for easy access to use in `Azure data factory` for retraining on new data continously (DataOps & MLOps)\n",
